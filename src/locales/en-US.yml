_config:
  servers: NATS server URLs
  noRandomize: If enabled, the client will not shuffle the servers list order when instantiating the connection, nor will it shuffle the list of IP addresses resolved from the server hostname DNS. Disabling this option enables load balancing across multiple servers, avoiding always connecting to the first available server.
  reconnect: Actively reconnect after client disconnection
  maxReconnectAttempts: Maximum number of reconnection attempts per server, set to -1 to never give up reconnecting
  authenticator: Client authentication scheme. When the server requires authentication, the authentication scheme here will be used.
  tlsEnabled: TLS can encrypt communication between client and server and verify the server's identity.
  name: Client name. After setting, the NATS server monitoring page will display this name when referring to this client.
  noAsyncTraces: When `true` the client will not add additional context to errors associated with request operations. Setting this option to `true` will greatly improve performance of request/reply and JetStream publishers.
  debug: When set to `true`, the client will use the javascript console object (not [koishi Logger](https://koishi.chat/zh-CN/api/utils/logger.html)) to print protocol messages it receives or sends to the server.
  tlsConfig:
    handshakeFirst: "Enable TLS handshake first mode (requires server configuration handshakeFirst: true)"
    certFile: Client certificate file path
    cert: (Or) Client certificate content
    caFile: CA certificate file path
    ca: (Or) CA certificate content
    keyFile: Client private key file path
    key: (Or) Client private key content
